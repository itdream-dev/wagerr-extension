Dear Wagerr Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake Wagerr window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. Wagerr will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to either [our phishing blacklist](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues) or our support email at [wagerr@bitcoin.com](mailto:wagerr@bitcoin.com).

Please read our full article on this ongoing issue at [https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168](https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168).
